           <h3>Grinding the Batter</h3>

    Wash and soak urad dal and rice in water overnight. Then, filter out the extra water and grind it to make a fine paste.
    Add the rice and urad dal with just as required water. Save the extra water.
    Slowly add water as required to make a smooth batter.
    Keep aside the mixture for 4 to 5 hours for fermentation.
    Add salt and water to the paste for making the batter a little thin. Make sure the batter doesn’t get too watery.
    This is the regular method of making, however, what’s also suggested is that you can make the pithas after 30 minutes of
    grinding and fermentation.

        <li> <h3>Making the Pithas</h3>

            Heat a nonstick tawa on a medium flame.
            When the pan gets heated, grease well with cooking oil.
            Take a ladleful of batter and spread it all over the pan in a circular shape.
            After a while, check the lower side of the pitha. Once the lower side turns brownish, flip it to the other side.
            When the pancake (pitha) is cooked well from both sides, switch off the stove. Repeat the procedure for all the pithas (pancakes).
            Serve hot with Aloo Bhaja, Ghuguni, and Jaggery on sides.
